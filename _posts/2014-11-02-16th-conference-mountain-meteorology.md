Last August the American Meteorological Society held the [16th Conference on Mountain Meteorology](http://www2.ametsoc.org/stac/index.cfm/committees/committee-on-mountain-meteorology/conferences/) in San Diego, California. In this opportunity, I presented some results of the paper I'm working on along with David Kingsmill. 

Essentially, we argue that one of the forcing mechanisms of orographic precipitation along the coastal mountains of northern California is trough terrain-trapped airflows (TTA). We introduce this concept as a generalization of well known low-level blocked flows and coastal channeled flows.

More details about TTAs and the abovementioned study will be available (hopefully) soon in an article we submitted to Monthly Weather Review.

Here is the [recorded presentation](https://ams.confex.com/ams/16MountMet/videogateway.cgi/id/28258?recordingid=28258)

Let me know if you have any comment.
