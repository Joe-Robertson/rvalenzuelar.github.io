Usually when you learn a new programming language, the first example is a "hello_world" program. Therefore, since I'm learning about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (which is supporting this website) and given that this is my first post, I decided to use this cliche title.

I'll be posting about topics in mountain meteorology (especially orographic precipitation), atmospheric sciences, progress in my research, some Matlab tips that I've learned during my PhD, and pictures of clouds that I've taken. Also, I'll talk about Matlab, and their differences and similarities.

Please, feel free to send me feedback about any article. Since I'm not a native english speaker, comments about typos/wording/grammar are especially welcome.

If you find any original content in this website interesting and you'd like to use it, please send me an email. I'll be glad to know that these stuff are useful to someone. Also, I'd appreciate refering to this site as the source.
