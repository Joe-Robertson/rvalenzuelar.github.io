Usually when you learn a new programming language the first example is a "hello_world" program. Therefore, since I'm learning about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (which is supporting this website) and given that this is my first post, I decided to use this cliche title.

I'll be posting about topics in meteorology (especially orographic precipitation), progress in my research, some Matlab tips that I've learned during my PhD, and cloud pictures that I've shot.

Comments about typos/wording/grammar are welcome.
