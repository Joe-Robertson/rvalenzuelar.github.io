This is the first in a series of book reviews that I inted to make. Somehow, I developed a compulsion for books and today I need to control my self to keep the pointer of my mouse far from the Amazon's "add to car" button when I see a book I like. Perhaps it is because in my home country (Chile) books are ridicously expensive or just because being a click away from a book I like is very temptative. Whatever the reason might be, I feel fortunate to have access to the physical copies of really nice books in atmospheric science and I would like to share what I have and I haven't learned from these sources of knowledge.

Since my experience in the field of atmospheric science is short (2-3 years) I will not make that kind of review that you might expect to see in a scientific journal, usually made by people who has a long career in the field to people who has a long experience in the field. Instead, I will provide an informal conversation with my younger self back maybe 2, 3, or 4 years ago, to tell what I could learn from each book and if they are plain boring or somehow fun.

And because fun is better than boring (not only in science of course) I will begin with one of the textbooks that I like the most within the atmospheric science field (yes, I read other stuff too). This book, titled Atmospheric Thermodynamics and written by Craig Bohren, is the first textbook in thermodynamics that I have read almost entearly. Partially because is fun and partially because I am always trying to find answer from it.

I first knew about Craig Bohren while taking a course in atmospheric radiative transfer with Cora Randall. Thankfully, Cora recomended one of the Bohren's book in radiative transfer. If you read that book and you don't laugh or at least smile after 3 or 4 pages then either I have a weird sense of humor that I share with Craig or you have a weird sense of humor and should hang out more. Anyway, after some googling I learned that Craig also had a book in thermodynamics. 

Thermodynamics has been a subject a bit obscure to me. I feel did not have a good base from school; however, I've always felt curiosity about the concept of energy that thermodynamics provides. Also, I like this agregated point of view of the molecules, because, at least to some extent, reminds me about people's behavior. Nevertheless, thermodynamics is not an fun subject by itself and personally I don't see anyone liking thermodynamics except for people wondering about energy from a systematic and quantitative point of view. Notice that you might also wonder about energy from a spiritual point of view, but in that case you should read something about Budhissm or Tai Chi.

So, the subject is not fun by itself. Then, that is where Craig makes one if his largest (in my opinion) achivements. 

[I think that among all of them, this is my favorite. Not only Bohren put his best effort to explain the concepts in their simplest form, but also he makes a deligthful use of jokes and historical fun-facts to keep the reader interested and motivated to know the origin and extension of the most important concepts in thermodynamics. Perhaps the historical controversies are the most useful fun-facts. For example...Maybe what I like the most is that he is very critic with the loosly use of thermodynamic concepts and principles.
