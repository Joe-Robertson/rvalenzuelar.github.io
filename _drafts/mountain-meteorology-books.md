Here are two of the books I've used during my research and that are worth to check out. 



###Mountain Meteorology: Fundamentals and Applications

Author: David Whiteman

In my opinion, Whiteman's book is good for an entry level audience, perhaps senior undergrad and master/doctorate students that are first approaching to Mountain Meteorology (like me). 



###Mountain Weather Research and Forecasting: recent progress and current challenges

Editors: Fotini K. Chow, Stephan F.J. De Wekker, and Bradley J. Snyder

Insert review here. Awesome book.
