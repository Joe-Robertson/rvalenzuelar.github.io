These are books that I have extensively used during my PhD, especially during the first two year of the program. As a result, most of them are in poor physical conditions today, but still usable.

This review does not intend to be complete nor detailed. It is from my short experience in the field of atmospheric sciences (about 3 yrs). However, it will be especially usefull for those who are shifting their career to atmospheric science and they had small or no experience/familiarity with atmospheric sciences topics previously.

Most of these books were included in the syllabus of the PhD courses and the rest showed up on my way home.



###Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics

Author: Vallis




###Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change

Author: Seinfeld and Pandis

One of the biggest book I have used in my life. As the title clearly suggest, it covers a good number of topics and with an appreciable level of detail. I mostly used the cloud and precipitation chapters. The introduction is a good review of basics.


###A First Course in Atmospheric Radiation

Author: Petty

My introduction to radiative transfer was very limited during my undergrad program. Therefore, it was very dificult to asimilate all these "abstract" concepts just in a semestre. Thankfully, Petty makes things a bit easier to people who is initiating in atmospheric sciences. 


###An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology

Author: Holton

I remember my Physics professor recomending me to read Holton to answer one of the questions that I asked him while I was undergrad. And I still rembember that that was like a whole foreing language to me (even in Spanish). Then, during my graduate student days this book has been a good support for concepts that are used frequently in atmosferic sciences. Nevertheless, I would say that you need to complement it with other books. At least to me, some of the explanations assumed that you had a previous knowledge either of physics or atmospheric sciences. In other words, I thinks that some explanations are not streightforward. 


###Atmospheric Sciences: An Introductory Survey

Author: John Wallace and Peter Hobbs

From what I've heard, Wallace and Hobbs is a classic among first year graduate students.


###A Short Course in Cloud Physics

Author: Rogers and Yau

It is focused in cloud microphysics.


###Atmospheric Thermodynamics

Author: Craig Bohren

I think that among all of them, this is my favorite. Not only Bohren put his best effort to explain the concepts in their simplest form, but also he makes a deligthful use of jokes and historical fun-facts to keep the reader interested and motivated to know the origin and extension of the most important concepts in thermodynamics. Perhaps the historical controversies are the most useful fun-facts. For example...
Maybe what I like the most is that he is very critic with the loosly use of thermodynamic concepts and principles. For instance...




###Fundamentals of Atmospheric Radiation: An Introduction with 400 Problems

Author: Craig Bohren and Eugene Clothiaux

I accessed to a copy of this books when I was taking the Introduction to Radiative Transfer course. I don't recall the exact concept I was looking for, but I remember that when I read the authors explanation...it was like "oooh! now I get it!". Even though I'm not in the radiative transfer field, if it were a bit cheaper I would definetly buy it because it is an excelent source of precise qualitatively and quantitevely definitions. If you are looking for foolproof explanation in radiative transfer, this is your book.

The book covers the following chapters:

1. Emission: The Birth of Photons
2. Absorption: The Death of Photons
3. Scattering: The Life of Photons
4. Radiometry and Photometry: What You Get and What You See
5. Multiple Scattering: Elementary
6. Multiple Scattering: Advanced
7. Polarization: The Hidden Variable
8. Meteorological Optics: The Reward
