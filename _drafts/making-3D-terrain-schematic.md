I was one of those kids attracted to books containing more draws and figures than words. Not surprisingly, the scientific world is full of papers with figures so I keep attracted to a neat figures in any paper.

In my research about mountain precipitation, I found this figure:

<figure>
	<a href="/images/professional_schematic.jpg"><img src="/images/professional_schematic.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption>Example of a professional artistic schematic</figcaption>
</figure>





I tried to track back the author and see if he/she could give me some advice in how to reach a similar result. Not the same result because I know this is also art and I’m not an artist. Unfourtunately, I couldn’t find the author; however, I figured out a solution to make my scheme somewhat closer to what I was looking for.

In this tutorial I’ll show you how I made this figure, which I included as the schematic of my paper:

[insert schematic]

#Tools:

* Patience
* Google Sketchup
* Inkscape (or any similar)


#First steps

As you already noticed, this tutorial is about a 3D schemtic that involves a perspective view of a elevation terrain. However, Google Sketchup (GS) allows you to make any kind of 3D figure (so far I know), so can also try it for a schematic of different nature (e.g. pipes, houses, etc).

I’ve seen tutorial using Blend to create a terrain from a Digital Elevation Model. This could also be an alternative but I haven’t explored Blend to do so. If you have reached similar (or even better) results with Blend please send me an email.
