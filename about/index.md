I'm Raul Valenzuela, from Chile. I studied Natural Resources Engineer at University of Chile and then
moved to Boulder, Colorado to start a PhD in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at University of Colorado Boulder.

My research interests include:

* Orographic precipitation forcing
* Mountain meteorology 
* Radar meteorology (ground-based and airborne)

I'll be posting about progress in my research and also some Matlab tips that I've learned during my PhD
