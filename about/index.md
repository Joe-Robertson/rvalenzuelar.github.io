I'm Raul Valenzuela, from Chile. I studied Natural Resources Engineer at University of Chile and then
moved to Boulder, Colorado to start a PhD in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at University of Colorado Boulder.

I started to work at NOAA/PSD with David Kingsmill in 2012 as a research assistant. We are looking at ground based radar observations to analyze the the airflow and precipitation structure associated with the coastal mountains of northern California. We try to understand the association between the airflow produced/forced by the mountains and the precipitation enhancement offshore near the coast, along the coast, and over the coastal mountains.

I've presented partial results in the last AMS Mountain Meteorology and Radar Meteorology conferenses:
* one
* two

The next step in my research is to look at airborne radar observations and see what can we learn from this top-down perspective. The challenge here is to re-navigate the data to compensate by the aircraft motion.

###My research interests include:

* Orographic precipitation forcing
* Mountain meteorology 
* Radar meteorology (ground-based and airborne)
