I'm Raul Valenzuela, from Chile. I studied Natural Resources Engineer at University of Chile and then
moved to Boulder, Colorado to start a PhD in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at University of Colorado Boulder.

I started to work at NOAA/PSD with David Kingsmill in 2012 as a research assistant. We are looking at ground based radar observations to analyze the airflow and precipitation structure associated with the coastal mountains of northern California. We try to understand the association between the airflow forced by the mountains and the precipitation enhancement offshore near the coast, along the coast, and over the coastal mountains.
  
The next step in my research is to look at airborne radar observations and see what can we learn from this top-down perspective. The challenge here is to re-navigate the data to compensate by the aircraft motion.

###Scientific meetings

I've presented partial results in the following AMS meetings:


* [16th Conference on Mountain Meteorology](https://ams.confex.com/ams/16MountMet/webprogram/Paper251866.html)
* [36th Conference on Radar Meteorology](https://ams.confex.com/ams/36Radar/webprogram/Paper228797.html)


###Research interests 

I can say that the motivation for my research started with my undergrad thesis. In this work I applied a zonification method to allocate Olive crops in certain basin in Chile. One of the criteria for allocation was the differences in climatoligcal characteristics within the basin; for exmaple, the microclimates. I realized that there were statistically significant climatic differences along the basin; however, I did not have enough knowledge about physics to explain or even understand the origin of those spacial differences.

Thus, nowadays I'm using advanced tools such as scanning radars that allow me to observe and understand a bit more about how mountains can induce spatial differences in the atmosphere. For instance, how mountains can induce changes in the wind field through low-level blocking or gap flows. In addition, now I have a better knowledge about how this changes in the wind field can affect the spatial distribution of precipitation.

So, thesedays my research interests can be grouped as: 

* Orographic precipitation forcing
* Mountain meteorology 
* Radar meteorology (ground-based and airborne)
